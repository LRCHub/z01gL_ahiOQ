All the things you said to me last night
They closed my eyes
Instead of opening my mind
And maybe talking less and doing more
Will bring us back to where we lived before

As ginger sweet and spicy we are both
Unable to balm, unable to choke
And even when our energy is low
We can go back to where we lived before
