When you leave it will be cold outside
Swing from tree to tree you're bound to die
Ginger disappears with the snow
And she comes and goes but she mostly goes
Can't be sure of a lot of things she knows

She soldout poems about the south
She blows wide "O" rings threw her mouth
He keeps her nose warm with his hand
When gravel hits the ground they call it sand
She's throwing lawn darts threw a map
Singing "hey man like there's where it's at"
That's the place for me
And that's where i'll be
Anywhere i want
Anywhere i wanna be
And i'm what you wanna be
Well i'm where you want to be

And i know somedays you just die
Just as you dont really even try
Ginger knows and she knows that it blows
And she comes and goes but she mostly goes
Can't be sure of a lot of things she knows

And you sold out poems about the south
She blows wide "O" rings threw his mouth
She keeps his nose warm with her hand
When gravel hits the ground they call it sand
She's throwing lawn darts threw a map
Singing "hey man like there's where it's at"
That's the place for me
And thats where i'll be
Anywhere i want
Anywhere i wanna be
I'm what you want to be
Anywhere i wanna be

Ginger snows a lot about her lives
She talks about how "oh so hard she trys"
Ginger knows and she knows that it blows
And she comes and goes but she mostly goes
And she comes and goes but she mostly goes
