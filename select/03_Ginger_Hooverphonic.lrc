[01:14.17] All the things you sad to me last night
[01:19.25] They closed my eyes
[01:22.82] Instead of opening my mind
[01:27.50] And maybe talking less and doing more
[01:33.65] Will bring us back to where we lived before
[01:55.15] 
[01:57.41] As ginger sweet and spicy we are both
[02:02.97] Unable to balm, unable to choke
[02:11.71] And even when our energy is low
[02:17.86] We can go back to where we lived before
