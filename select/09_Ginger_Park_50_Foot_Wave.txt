French fries glisten in the noon day sun
I wouldn't mention this to anyone
Where the hell do those sheep think they're going?
As soon as I pay up, I'm getting out of here

Could you leave us alone for just a minute?

Lately, my life has been flashing before my eyes
Lately, my life has been passing by
I know I should be concerned about what this means
But I just keep watching

Could you leave us alone for just a minute?

Where do you think you are?
Ginger Park
Where do you think you are?
Ginger Park

I don't belong there, I don't belong anywhere
I don't belong there, I don't belong anywhere
I don't belong there and I guess and I never will
And I don't belong anywhere

Could you leave us alone for just a minute?

Where do you think you are?
Ginger Park
